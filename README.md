# VACUUM CLEANER

It is generally electrically driven the dirt is collected by either a dustbag or a cyclone for later disposal. Vacuum cleaners, which areused in homes as well as in industry, exist in a variety of sizes and models—small battery-powered hand-held devices, wheeled canister models for home use, domestic central vacuum cleaners, huge stationary industrial appliances that can handle several hundred litres of dirt before being emptied,and self-propelled vacuum trucks for recovery of large spills or removal of contaminated soil.Specialized shop vacuums can be used to suck up both solid matter and liquids.

***Welcome to the clean world of ocean blue*** !Dear Customer!

Thank you for your confidence in our product. It is our goal to bring you into the clean world of OceanBlue.**If you have been using a “Conventional” cleaning system for dirt removal you might be in for surprise**.
If you find that you are having to empty the water pan more often than you think that you should, be aware that, in the beginning, you are picking up more dirt because of the deep dirt that is in your carpets that was not removed before. After using the OceanBlue for a short time in regular use, you should find that the amount of dirt will taper off to more “normal” expectations.You should be aware that deep dirt is the enemy of carpets.

The deep dirt left in the carpet acts like little knives and slowly cuts the tufts of the carpets at the bottom as you walk on the carpet.**You may see a lot of “fuzz” coming up from the carpet in the beginning, but by removing this deep dirt, you are increasing the life of your carpet**.Remember that the OceanBlue filtration system does not clog up the airflow as you use it. You still have full power right up to when to empty the water pan.
