# VACUUM CLEANER
**A vacuum cleaner**, also known simply as a vacuum or a hoover, is a device that causes suction in order to remove dirt from floors, upholstery, draperies, and other surfaces. It is generally electrically driven the dirt is collected by either a dustbag or a cyclone for later disposal. Vacuum cleaners, which areused in homes as well as in industry, exist in a variety of sizes and models—small battery-powered hand-held devices, wheeled canister models for home use, domestic central vacuum cleaners, huge stationary industrial appliances that can handle several hundred litres of dirt before being emptied,and self-propelled vacuum trucks for recovery of large spills or removal of contaminated soil.Specialized shop vacuums can be used to suck up both solid matter and liquids.

***Welcome to the clean world of ocean blue*** Dear Customer!

Thank you for your confidence in our product. It is our goal to bring you into the clean world of OceanBlue.**If you have been using a “Conventional” cleaning system for dirt removal you might be in for surprise**.
If you find that you are having to empty the water pan more often than you think that you should, be aware that, in the beginning, you are picking up more dirt because of the deep dirt that is in your carpets that was not removed before. After using the OceanBlue for a short time in regular use, you should find that the amount of dirt will taper off to more “normal” expectations.You should be aware that deep dirt is the enemy of carpets.

The deep dirt left in the carpet acts like little knives and slowly cuts the tufts of the carpets at the bottom as you walk on the carpet.**You may see a lot of “fuzz” coming up from the carpet in the beginning, but by removing this deep dirt, you are increasing the life of your carpet**.Remember that the OceanBlue filtration system does not clog up the airflow as you use it. You still have full power right up to when to empty the water pan.

**OPTIONAL ACCESSORIES Prolux Storm**


The Prolux Storm has incorporated an electronically driven brush roll to this universal shampoo system. This design allows the shampoo system to agitate the surface which improves cleaning ability exponentially. This model works just like your regular power nozzle does, so all you must do is fill it up, and vacuum like you normally would. Offers much higher power output than other shampooers on the market and offers self-adjusting brush roll height so you can easily move between surfaces. The self-adjusting design is exceptionally convenient when using on tile because it allows the brush roll to drop into and scrub grouted areas. OceanBlue Water Based Air Purifier: This works as a humidifier, deodorizer, purifier, aromatherapy and fragrance machine. For aromatherapy or to use as an air freshener, add a few drops of fragrance into the water bowl and turn on. This OceanBlue also works as a humidifier by pushing moisture into the air and leaving the impurities behind in the water bowl to be disposed of. The best park is that this purifier does not over dispense moisture, so you will never have to worry about water left behind and is safe to use in any area! Stair Pro Electric Mini Turbo: Quick connect button lock to attach to your wand or vacuum handle. Brush roll is powered by durable electric motor and a geared belt that will last the lifetime of the tool. If you have pet hair you need to vacuum up this is a must! Not only do they last for many years but they deep clean better than almost anything.

**GENERAL PRECAUTIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS**               

$${\color{red}**IMPORTANT**}$$

Please read all instructions before using this machine and keep this manual always at hand. Follow the instructions manual for the Ocean Blue‘s. Do not try to use it otherwise. The use of non-authorized accessories by OceanBlue could be dangerous. See section 
**SERVICING OF DOUBLE INSULATED APPLIANCE**

• The OceanBlue must not be used to clear sewers. An explosion may occur if the machine suctions sewer gases.
• You must NEVER touch a metallic kitchen sink or washbasin or water pipelines with one hand while holding the machine with the other hand. The danger is greater if the
person’s skin is wet.
• Take special care when cleaning stairs


$${\color{red}**ATTENTION**}$$  

It is not recommended to use the OceanBlue for cleaning chimneys or open stoves, or other devices that have oil or grease, for example, soot or ashes, clay dust, plaster or other similar materials that are resistant to water action. It must not be used for vacuuming toxic or volatile substances or near any of these PRECAUTIONS WHEN VACUUMING LIQUIDS Always consider the following precautions:
**Always consider the following precautions**:
**DO NOT** operate the machine with wet hands or feet or barefoot.
**NEVER use** OceanBlue to clean up liquids outdoors, upon an earth floor.
**NEVER** vacuum liquids with OceanBlue when you are stepping on water or a wet floor. If it should be necessary to step on a wet or damp floor to pick up water, do not touch the metallic parts of ANY electric device, lamp or switch while performing this operation.
**DO NOT** carry the machine with your hand while using the machine for cleaning
operations.
• The water container must be empty before you begin picking up liquids. 
**DO NOT** vacuum more than 1.9 liters (2 quarts); the water level MUST NEVER be above the central post.
Excess water in the water container will cause shaking and vibration. If this occurs, the vibrations are your warning that the water container is overfilled.



**SPECIAL CARE & SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS**



**WATER**:**Do not** operate the OceanBlue for too long without changing the water. When you notice that the water is getting too full of dust and fuzz, throw it away and replace it with clean water.

**WATER CONTAINER**: 



When you finish cleaning your house, be careful to put away the OceanBlue‘s motor apart from the water container between uses. ALWAYS empty the water container after each use.
**THE HYDROTURBINE IS THE HEART OF YOUR MACHINE**  Unplug the OceanBlue from the power outlet. Remove and clean the  HydroTurbine after each use. Wash it inside and out with water and soap, using the brush provided. Dry it and put in place again. Tighten the nut by hand until the fl at surface of the HydroTurbine is properly adjusted. Do not over tighten, as the HydroTurbine automatically tightens upon starting the machine. The HydroTurbine is the key for separating the dirty water from the airflow and proper care is important for the performance of your appliance. If the HydroTurbine should become damaged (CHIPPED OR BROKEN), replace the HydroTurbine with a factory made turbine from your Service Center. 

**WARNING**: The OceanBlue must NEVER be used without the HydroTurbine. Always place it back after cleaning it.

**OPERATION AND HANDLING**


**General  guidelines for using OceanBlue**:


Fill up the water container with cold water until it almost covers the top of the central post: correct quantity of water 2.365 liters (2.5 quarts). (fig.1) The motor unit is placed on top of the water container (fi g.2). The air intake should be lined up
with the notch in the motor unit. The edge of the motor unit should be firmly rest on the top of the water container and be inside of the retaining ring for correct location, otherwise, the machine will not work. Engage the two clamps and raise the upper part of the clamps together. Place the machine on top of the wheeled base. Note: The clamps will not operate properly if the motor unit is not in the proper position on the water container. If the clamps do not operate easily, check the location of the motor unit.
Insert the plastic wand into the curved wand with the OceanBlue hose (fi g.3) until the button fits in place. Insert the plastic end of the OceanBlue hose into the vacuum air intake as shown (fi g.4), rotating it to right. To disconnect, rotate it to the left and pull it towards you.


#### WATER CONTAINER / HYDROTURBINE ####

***To empty the water container***:
1. Release both clamps by pulling the upper part of the clamp assembly down
and remove motor.
2. Pickup the water container by the vacuum intake end and empty the water.
3. Place the heavier particles in the bottom of the water container in a trash can (such as wet fuzz).
4. Wash, rinse and dry the water  container
5. Keep the motor apart from the  water container until next use.

**Care of HydroTurbine**:

Take out the turbine after each use and wash it inside and out with water and soap, using the special supplied tool. Dry it and put it back in its place. Tighten the nut by hand until the turbine is seated and the rim is flush with the rim of the metal casting of the motor. Do not over tighten, as the HydroTurbine automatically tightens up on starting the machine.

$${\color{red}**WARNING:**}$$

The HydroTurbine must always be positioned back in its place immediately after you clean it. Do not operate the machine without the HydroTurbine.

#### USING YOUR VACUUM ####


**REMEMBER THE FOLLOWING WHEN USING YOUR VACUUM CLEANER**:


The functioning of your new cleaning equipment greatly depends on the maintenance given at home. Only use your OceanBlue equipment according to the instructions provided in this manual.
• Before using the machine pick up by hand any hard or sharp objects such as pins,
hairpins, thumbtacks, pieces of pencil, etc. that could harm the spinning brush roll.
• **Do not** lubricate the motor. The motor has permanent lubrication and is sealed.
• Shut down the machine before connecting hose.
• **Do not** use the machine to clean chimneys, open stoves, or other materials containing
oils, grease, soot, ashes, clay dust, plaster or other water-resistant materials.
• It must not be used either to vacuum volatile or toxic substances, nor to be operated
near them.
• SERVICING OF DOUBLE-INSULATED APPLICANCES
• A double-insulated appliance is marked with one or more of the following: The words
“DOUBLE INSULATION” or “DOUBLE INSULATED” or the double insulation symbol
(square within a square) .
• In a double-insulated appliance, two systems of insulation are provided instead
of grounding. No grounding means its provided on a double-insulated
appliance, nor should a means for grounding be added to the appliance.
Servicing a double-insulated appliance requires extreme care and knowledge
of the system and should be done only by qualified service personnel.
• Replacement parts for a double-insulated appliance must be identical to the
parts they replace.
All service operations, other than cleaning, must be done by an authorized service agent of OceanBlue.

**Troubleshooting for Electric Power Nozzle**


Problem – electric power nozzle does not power up (motor does not turn on in power nozzle). Solution –


**Please follow all the steps below and try again**:

a. Unplug cord from power nozzle on hose, count 20 seconds and plug back in.
b. Make sure the brush roll can roll freely and nothing is obstructing it.
c. Make sure hose is firmly “snapped” into canister.
d. Make sure main electrical wand is firmly “snapped” all the way to the hose.
e. Make sure main electrical wand is firmly “snapped” all the way into the power nozzle.
f. For models with reset button, firmly press reset button on electrical power nozzle.
g. On the hose is an on/off switch. Make sure that it is turned to on.
h. On the Power Nozzle there is an on/off button; make sure that is turned on as well. If you plug the power nozzle directly into the hose and it turns on (but won’t turn on with main wand attached,) then you know the main wand is defective or a connection needs adjusting (see last problem below).
Problem – electric power nozzle turns on, but brush roll does not spin.
Solution – Most likely a large object may have been vacuumed up, jammed the brush roll and broke the belt.
Remove bottom plate of the power nozzle, check or replace belt, remove obstruction and try again.
Problem – electric power nozzle cuts in and out as you vacuum back and forth.
Solution – There are several connections to get power to the power nozzle, they are: 1) the hose and canister, 2) the hose and main wand and 3) the main wand and power head. Make sure each of these is  firmly connected. If you have traced the ‘cutting out’ problem to one of these areas and they are firmly connected, then when the vacuum is unplugged from the wall, you may take a pair of needle-nose pliers and slightly bend the male terminal out, so it has a better connection.
