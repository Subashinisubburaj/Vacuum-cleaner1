# VACUUM CLEANER
A vacuum cleaner, also known simply as a vacuum or a hoover, is a device that causes suction in order to remove dirt from floors, upholstery, draperies, and other surfaces. It is generally electrically driven the dirt is collected by either a dustbag or a cyclone for later disposal. Vacuum cleaners, which areused in homes as well as in industry, exist in a variety of sizes and models—small battery-powered hand-held devices, wheeled canister models for home use, domestic central vacuum cleaners, huge stationary industrial appliances that can handle several hundred litres of dirt before being emptied,and self-propelled vacuum trucks for recovery of large spills or removal of contaminated soil.Specialized shop vacuums can be used to suck up both solid matter and liquids.

***Welcome to the clean world of ocean blue*** !Dear Customer!

Thank you for your confidence in our product. It is our goal to bring you into the clean world of OceanBlue.**If you have been using a “Conventional” cleaning system for dirt removal you might be in for surprise**.
If you find that you are having to empty the water pan more often than you think that you should, be aware that, in the beginning, you are picking up more dirt because of the deep dirt that is in your carpets that was not removed before. After using the OceanBlue for a short time in regular use, you should find that the amount of dirt will taper off to more “normal” expectations.You should be aware that deep dirt is the enemy of carpets.

The deep dirt left in the carpet acts like little knives and slowly cuts the tufts of the carpets at the bottom as you walk on the carpet.**You may see a lot of “fuzz” coming up from the carpet in the beginning, but by removing this deep dirt, you are increasing the life of your carpet**.Remember that the OceanBlue filtration system does not clog up the airflow as you use it. You still have full power right up to when to empty the water pan.

**OPTIONAL ACCESSORIES Prolux Storm**
The Prolux Storm has incorporated an electronically driven brush roll to this universal shampoo system. This design allows the shampoo system to agitate the surface which improves cleaning ability exponentially. This model works just like your regular power nozzle does, so all you must do is fill it up, and vacuum like you normally would. Offers much higher power output than other shampooers on the market and offers self-adjusting brush roll height so you can easily move between surfaces. The self-adjusting design is exceptionally convenient when using on tile because it allows the brush roll to drop into and scrub grouted areas. OceanBlue Water Based Air Purifier: This works as a humidifier, deodorizer, purifier, aromatherapy and fragrance machine. For aromatherapy or to use as an air freshener, add a few drops of fragrance into the water bowl and turn on. This OceanBlue also works as a humidifier by pushing moisture into the air and leaving the impurities behind in the water bowl to be disposed of. The best park is that this purifier does not over dispense moisture, so you will never have to worry about water left behind and is safe to use in any area! Stair Pro Electric Mini Turbo: Quick connect button lock to attach to your wand or vacuum handle. Brush roll is powered by durable electric motor and a geared belt that will last the lifetime of the tool. If you have pet hair you need to vacuum up this is a must! Not only do they last for many years but they deep clean better than almost anything.
